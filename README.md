Key Systems administrator privilege escalation

The Key Systems network-attached electronic safe allows an administrative user to open the safe and release keys through the web interface.  The device also emits logs containing the web session ID when an administrator successfully logs in.  By monitoring these logs you can manipulate the GET request and gain administrative access.
